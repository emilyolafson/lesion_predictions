  abstract = "Behavioural deficits in stroke reflect both structural damage at
              the site of injury, and widespread network dysfunction caused by
              structural, functional, and metabolic disconnection. Two recent
              methods allow for the estimation of structural and functional
              disconnection from clinical structural imaging. This is achieved
              by embedding a patient's lesion into an atlas of functional and
              structural connections in healthy subjects, and deriving the
              ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass
              through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the
              whole brain connectome. This indirect assessment of network
              dysfunction is more readily available than direct measures of
              functional and structural connectivity obtained with functional
              and diffusion MRI, respectively, and it is in theory applicable
              to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical
              relevance of these methods, we quantified the prediction of
              behavioural deficits in a prospective cohort of 132 first-time
              stroke patients studied at 2 weeks post-injury (mean age 52.8
              years, range 22-77; 63 females; 64 right hemispheres).
              Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate
              deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual,
              left and right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and
              verbal memory) with the pattern of lesion and indirect structural
              or functional disconnection. In a subgroup of patients, we also
              measured direct alterations of functional connectivity with
              resting-state functional MRI. Both lesion and indirect structural
              disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in
              all domains (0.16 < R2 < 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 <
              R2 < 0.06). Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was
              scarce or negligible (0.01 < R2 < 0.18) except for the right
              visual field deficits (R2 = 0.38), even though multivariate maps
              were anatomically plausible in all domains. Prediction from
              direct measures of functional MRI functional connectivity in a
              subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional
              disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of
              structural connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural
              deficits post-stroke to a level comparable to lesion information.
              However, indirect estimation of functional disconnection did not
              predict behavioural deficits, nor was a substitute for direct
              functional connectivity measurements, especially for cognitive
              disorders.",

              impairment after a stroke relates to lesion size and location,
              but unexplained variability in recovery still exists. In this
              study, we used lesion-mapping techniques in combination with
              diffusion tensor imaging to quantitatively test the hypothesis
              that motor recovery in patients with chronic stroke is inversely
              related to the proportion of the corticospinal tract (CST)
              affected by the lesion. METHODS: We studied 50 patients with
              chronic stroke, all of whom presented with moderate to severe
              motor impairments in the acute stage, using high-resolution
              anatomic MRI. We evaluated the degree of motor impairment with
              the Upper Extremity module of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. To
              analyze the relationship between CST damage and impairment
              scores, we calculated a CST-lesion load for each patient by
              overlaying the patient's lesion map with a probabilistic tract
              derived from diffusion tensor images of age-matched healthy
              subjects. RESULTS: CST-lesion load was a significant predictor of
              motor deficit. Infarct size, despite correlating with motor
              scores, did not significantly predict impairment. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our results show the degree of functional motor deficit after a
              stroke is highly dependent on the overlap of the lesion with the
              CST and not lesion size per se. In the future, automated
              calculation of CST-lesion load may allow more precise prediction
              of motor impairment after stroke.",

              has been shown to have a major effect on upper extremity motor
              recovery after stroke. This study aimed to examine how well CST
              injury, measured from neuroimaging acquired during the acute
              stroke workup, predicts upper extremity motor recovery. Methods-
              Patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were
              assessed using the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer during the acute
              stroke hospitalization and again at 3-month follow-up. CST injury
              was quantified and compared, using 4 different methods, from
              images obtained as part of the stroke standard-of-care workup.
              Logistic and linear regression were performed using CST injury to
              predict $\Delta$Fugl-Meyer. Injury to primary motor and premotor
              cortices were included as potential modifiers of the effect of
              CST injury on recovery. Results- N=48 patients were enrolled
              4.2$\pm$2.7 days poststroke and completed 3-month follow-up
              (median 90-day modified Rankin Scale score, 3; interquartile
              range, 1.5). CST injury distinguished patients who reached their
              recovery potential (as predicted from initial impairment) from
              those who did not, with area under the curve values ranging from
              0.70 to 0.8. In addition, CST injury explained $\approx$20\% of
              the variance in the magnitude of upper extremity recovery, even
              after controlling for the severity of initial impairment. Results
              were consistent when comparing 4 different methods of measuring
              CST injury. Extent of injury to primary motor and premotor
              cortices did not significantly influence the predictive value
              that CST injury had for recovery. Conclusions- Structural injury
              to the CST, as estimated from standard-of-care imaging available
              during the acute stroke hospitalization, is a robust way to
              distinguish patients who achieve their predicted recovery
              potential and explains a significant amount of the variance in
              poststroke upper extremity motor recovery.",

              infarct size, infarct location, and integrity of motor tracts. To
              determine the value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a
              predictor of motor outcome and its role as a structural surrogate
              marker of impairment in chronic stroke, we tested correlations
              between motor impairment and DTI-derived measures of motor tract
              integrity. METHODS: Thirty-five chronic stroke patients with
              varying degrees of recovery underwent DTI and motor impairment
              assessments. Fibers originating from the precentral gyrus were
              traced and separated into pyramidal tract (PT) and alternate
              motor fibers (aMF). Asymmetry indices of fiber number and
              regional fractional anisotropy (FA) values comparing lesional
              with nonlesional hemispheres were correlated with motor
              impairment scores and compared to an age-matched control group.
              RESULTS: Fiber number and regional FA value asymmetry
              significantly differed between the groups with lower values in
              the patients' lesional hemispheres. Both measures significantly
              predicted motor impairment with stronger predictions when all
              motor tracts were combined as compared to predictions using only
              the PT. The pattern of motor tract damage (PT only vs PT and aMF)
              led to a classification of mild, moderate, or severe impairment
              with significant between-group differences in motor impairment
              scores. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging-derived measures
              are valid structural markers of motor impairment. The integrity
              of all descending motor tracts, not merely the pyramidal tract,
              appears to account for stroke recovery. A 3-tier, hierarchical
              classification of impairment categories based on the pattern of
              motor tract damage is proposed that might be helpful in
              predicting recovery potential.",

  abstract = "Our knowledge of the anatomical organization of the human brain
              in health and disease draws heavily on the study of patients with
              focal brain lesions. Historically the first method of mapping
              brain function, it is still potentially the most powerful,
              establishing the necessity of any putative neural substrate for a
              given function or deficit. Great inferential power, however,
              carries a crucial vulnerability: without stronger alternatives
              any consistent error cannot be easily detected. A hitherto
              unexamined source of such error is the structure of the
              high-dimensional distribution of patterns of focal damage,
              especially in ischaemic injury-the commonest aetiology in
              lesion-deficit studies-where the anatomy is naturally shaped by
              the architecture of the vascular tree. This distribution is so
              complex that analysis of lesion data sets of conventional size
              cannot illuminate its structure, leaving us in the dark about the
              presence or absence of such error. To examine this crucial
              question we assembled the largest known set of focal brain
              lesions (n = 581), derived from unselected patients with acute
              ischaemic injury (mean age = 62.3 years, standard deviation =
              17.8, male:female ratio = 0.547), visualized with
              diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and processed with
              validated automated lesion segmentation routines.
              High-dimensional analysis of this data revealed a hidden bias
              within the multivariate patterns of damage that will consistently
              distort lesion-deficit maps, displacing inferred critical regions
              from their true locations, in a manner opaque to replication.
              Quantifying the size of this mislocalization demonstrates that
              past lesion-deficit relationships estimated with conventional
              inferential methodology are likely to be significantly displaced,
              by a magnitude dependent on the unknown underlying lesion-deficit
              relationship itself. Past studies therefore cannot be
              retrospectively corrected, except by new knowledge that would
              render them redundant. Positively, we show that novel machine
              learning techniques employing high-dimensional inference can
              nonetheless accurately converge on the true locus. We conclude
              that current inferences about human brain function and deficits
              based on lesion mapping must be re-evaluated with methodology
              that adequately captures the high-dimensional structure of lesion

              neurological biomarker(s) meet the high evidence quality criteria
              for use in predicting motor recovery. Methods We searched
              databases for prognostic neuroimaging/neurophysiological studies.
              Methodological quality of each study was assessed using a
              previously employed comprehensive 15-item rating system.
              Furthermore, we used the GRADE approach and ranked the overall
              evidence quality for each category of neurologic biomarker.
              Results Seventy-one articles met our inclusion criteria; 5
              categories of neurologic biomarkers were identified: diffusion
              tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), conventional
              structural MRI (sMRI), and a combination of these biomarkers.
              Most studies were conducted with individuals after ischemic
              stroke in the acute and/or subacute stage (~70\%). Less than
              one-third of the studies (21/71) were assessed with satisfactory
              methodological quality (80\% or more of total quality score).
              Conventional structural MRI and the combination biomarker
              categories ranked ``high'' in overall evidence quality.
              Conclusions There were 3 prevalent methodological limitations:
              (a) lack of cross-validation, (b) lack of minimal clinically
              important difference (MCID) for motor outcomes, and (c) small

              which neurological biomarkers are the best predictors of motor
              recovery after stroke. Finally, the quarter-century old

              ventral premotor cortices and supplementary motor area, all of
              which might potentially contribute to motor function after
              stroke. We sought to quantify the microstructural integrity of
              CST originating from the hand representations in these 4 motor
              cortices separately and examined how these values related to hand
              motor impairment. METHODS: Probabilistic tractography from
              functional MRI-defined cortical sites demonstrated continuous CST
              originating from hand representations within each motor area in a
              group of healthy subjects. Microstructural integrity for each
              tract was calculated using fractional anisotropy at the level of
              the posterior limb of the internal capsule in a group of patients
              with chronic stroke. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy was reduced
              in all 4 CSTs in the affected hemisphere. Grip strength
              correlated with the integrity of the CSTs originating from
              primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices, whereas, in a
              multiple regression model, the latter improved the ability of
              primary motor cortex CST to explain variability in grip strength.
              CONCLUSION: Handgrip critically depends on the CST originating in
              primary motor cortex but microstructural integrity of CST
              originating from premotor cortices appears to play a role in
              supporting motor function after stroke.",

              imaging measure of corticospinal tract (CST) injury in the acute
              phase can predict motor outcome at 3 months in comparison to
              clinical assessment of initial motor impairment. METHODS: A
              two-site prospective cohort study followed up a group of
              first-ever ischemic stroke patients using the Upper-Extremity
              Fugl-Meyer (UE-FM) Scale to measure motor impairment in the acute
              phase and at 3 months. A weighted CST lesion load (wCST-LL) was
              calculated by overlaying the patient's lesion map on magnetic
              resonance imaging with a probabilistic CST constructed from
              healthy control subjects. Regression models were fit to assess
              the predictive value of wCST-LL and compared with initial motor
              impairment. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (37 from cohort 1 and
              39 from cohort 2) completed the study. wCST-LL as well as
              assessment of motor impairment (UE-FM) in the acute phase
              correlated with motor impairment (UE-FM) at 3 months in both
              cohort 1 (R(2) = 0.69 vs. R(2) = 0.67; p = 0.43) and cohort 2
              (R(2) = 0.69 vs. R(2) = 0.62; p = 0.25). In the severely impaired
              subgroup (defined as UE-FM $\leq$ 10 at baseline), wCST-LL
              correlated with outcomes significantly better than clinical
              assessment (R(2) = 0.47 vs. R(2) = 0.11; p = 0.03). In the
              nonseverely impaired subgroup, stroke patients recovered
              approximately 70\% of their maximal recovery potential. All
              stroke patients in both cohorts had poor motor outcomes at 3
              months (defined as UE-FM $\leq$ 25) when wCST-LL was $\geq$ 7.0
              cc (positive predictive value was 100\%). INTERPRETATION:
              wCST-LL, an imaging biomarker determined in the acute phase, can
              predict poststroke motor outcomes at 3 months, especially in
              patients with severe impairment at baseline.",

              connectivity changes compared with the normal state. There are
              many methods with which to assess anatomical changes in
              structural or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, but most
              overlook the topology of white matter (WM) connections that make

              that associates alterations in WM integrity with expected changes
              in neural connectivity between gray matter regions. The NeMo Tool
              uses a large reference set of healthy tractograms to assess
              implied network changes arising from a particular pattern of WM
              alteration on a region- and network-wise level. In this way, WM

              increases the risk of overfitting, calling for the use of
              dimensionality reduction methods to build robust predictive
              models. In this work, we assess the ability of four well-known
              dimensionality reduction techniques to extract relevant features
              from resting state functional connectivity matrices of stroke
              patients, which are then used to build a predictive model of the
              associated deficits based on cross-validated regularized

              Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) were the

              strategies were so far used, and it is not known what strategy is

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infarct size on T2-weighted MRI
              correlates only modestly with outcome, particularly for small
              strokes. This may be largely because of differences in the
              locations of infarcts and consequently in the functional pathways
              that are damaged. To test this hypothesis quantitatively, we
              developed a ``mask'' of the corticospinal pathway to determine
              whether the extent of stroke intersection with the pathway would
              be more closely related to clinical motor deficit and axonal
              injury in the descending motor pathways than total stroke lesion
              volume. METHODS: Eighteen patients were studied > or =1 month
              after first ischemic stroke that caused a motor deficit by use of
              brain T2-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopic (MRS) measurements of
              the neuronal marker compound N-acetyl aspartate in the posterior
              limb of the internal capsule, and motor impairment and disability
              measures. A corticospinal mask based on neuroanatomic landmarks
              was generated from a subset of the MRI data. The maximum
              proportion of the cross-sectional area of this mask occupied by
              stroke was determined for each patient after all brain images
              were transformed into a common stereotaxic brain space. RESULTS:
              There was a significant linear relationship between the maximum
              proportional cross-sectional area of the corticospinal mask
              occupied by stroke and motor deficit (r(2)=0.82, P<0.001),
              whereas the relationship between the total stroke volume and
              motor deficit was better described by a cubic curve (r(2)=0.76,
              P<0.001). Inspection of the data plots showed that the total
              stroke volume discriminated poorly between smaller strokes with
              regard to the extent of associated motor deficit, whereas the
              maximum proportion of the mask cross-sectional area occupied by
              stroke appeared to be a more discriminatory marker of motor
              deficit and also N-acetyl aspartate reduction. CONCLUSIONS:
              Segmentation of functional motor pathways on MRI allows
              estimation of the extent of damage specifically to that pathway
              by the stroke lesion. The extent of stroke intersection with the
              motor pathways was more linearly related to the magnitude of
              motor deficit than total lesion volume and appeared to be a
              better discriminator between small strokes with regard to motor
              deficit. This emphasizes the importance of the anatomic
              relationship of the infarct to local structures in determining
              functional impairment. Prospective studies are necessary to
              assess whether this approach would allow improved early
              estimation of prognosis after stroke.",

              [primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and
              supplementary motor area (SMA)] and motor function. Anatomical
              connectivity between ipsilesional M1/SMA and the (1) cerebral
              peduncle, (2) thalamus, and (3) red nucleus were significantly
              correlated with upper and lower extremity motor performance (P
              $\leq$ 0.003). M1-M1 interhemispheric connectivity was also
              significantly correlated with gross manual dexterity of the
              affected upper extremity (P = 0.001). Regression models with M1
              lesion load and M1 disconnection (adjusted for time poststroke)
              explained a significant amount of variance in upper extremity
              motor performance (R2 = 0.36-0.46) and gait speed (R2 = 0.46),
              with M1 disconnection an independent predictor of motor
              performance. Cortical disconnection, especially of ipsilesional

  abstract = "Hemiparesis is a common consequence of stroke to the primary
              motor system. Previous studies suggested that damage to
              additional brain areas might play a causal role in the occurrence
              and severity of hemiparesis and its recovery. Knowledge of these
              regions might be applied in the creation of imaging biomarkers
              for motor outcome prediction if lesion information from such
              areas carries predictive value. We assessed acute and chronic
              paresis of the upper limb in 102 patients with unilateral stroke.
              In a first experiment, the neural correlates of acute and chronic
              upper limb paresis were mapped by lesion behaviour mapping.
              Following the same approach, a lesion biomarker of corticospinal
              tract (CST) damage was mapped. This analysis served as an
              artificial control condition as the biomarker, by definition, is
              only causally related to damage of the CST. Mapping acute or
              chronic upper limb paresis implicated areas outside of the
              primary motor system. Likewise, mapping the CST lesion biomarker
              implicated several areas outside of the CST with high
              correspondence to areas associated with upper limb paresis.
              Damage to areas outside of the primary motor system thus might,
              to some degree, not play a causal role in hemiparesis. In a
              second experiment, we showed that lesion information from these
              areas outside of the primary motor system can be used to predict
              motor outcome. This was even the case for the CST lesion
              biomarker. Although the only causal source underlying the CST
              lesion biomarker was damage to the CST, lesion information that
              mainly included non-CST regions was able to predict the biomarker
              (non-significantly) better than information taken from only the
              CST itself. These findings suggest that simple theory-based
              biomarkers or qualitative rules to infer post-stroke outcome from
              imaging data might perform sub-optimally, as they do not consider
              the complexity of lesion data. Instead, high-dimensional models
              with data-driven feature selection strategies might be required.

              individualized predictions and to account for the interaction
              among units of information in the brain. Application of machine
              learning in structural imaging to investigate diseases that
              involve brain injury presents an additional challenge, especially
              in conditions like stroke, due to the high variability across
              patients regarding characteristics of the lesions. Extracting
              data from anatomical images in a way that translates brain damage
              information into features to be used as input to learning
              algorithms is still an open question. One of the most common
              approaches to capture regional information from brain injury is
              to obtain the lesion load per region (i.e. the proportion of
              voxels in anatomical structures that are considered to be
              damaged). However, no systematic evaluation has yet been
              performed to compare this approach with using patterns of voxels
              (i.e. considering each voxel as a single feature). In this paper
              we compared both approaches applying Gaussian Process Regression
              to decode motor scores in 50 chronic stroke patients based solely
              on data derived from structural MRI. For both approaches we
              compared different ways to delimit anatomical areas: regions of
              interest from an anatomical atlas, the corticospinal tract, a
              mask obtained from fMRI analysis with a motor task in healthy
              controls and regions selected using lesion-symptom mapping. Our
              analysis showed that extracting features through patterns of
              voxels that represent lesion probability produced better results
              than quantifying the lesion load per region. In particular, from
              the different ways to delimit anatomical areas compared, the best
              performance was obtained with a combination of a range of
              cortical and subcortical motor areas as well as the corticospinal
              tract. These results will inform the appropriate methodology for

              is a popular approach to map functions in the human brain, and
              efforts to translationally apply lesion-behaviour modelling to
              predict post-stroke outcomes are on the rise. The
              high-dimensional complexity of lesion data, however, evokes
              challenges in both lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke
              outcome prediction. This paper aims to deepen the understanding
              of this complexity by reframing it from the perspective of causal
              and non-causal dependencies in the data, and by discussing what
              this complexity implies for different data modelling approaches.
              By means of theoretical discussion and empirical examination,
              several common strategies and views are challenged, and future
              research perspectives are outlined. A main conclusion is that
              lesion-behaviour inference is subject to a lesion-anatomical bias
              that cannot be overcome by using multivariate models or any other
              algorithm that is blind to causality behind relations in the
              data. This affects the validity of lesion behaviour mapping and
              might even wrongfully identify paradoxical effects of
              lesion-induced functional facilitation - but, as this paper
              argues, only to a minor degree. Thus, multivariate lesion-brain
              inference appears to be a valuable tool to deepen our
              understanding of the human brain, but only because it takes into
              account the functional relation between brain areas. The
              perspective of causality and inter-variable dependence is further
              used to point out challenges in improving lesion behaviour
              models. Firstly, the dependencies in the data open up different
              possible strategies of data reduction, and considering those
              might improve post-stroke outcome prediction. Secondly, the role
              of non-topographical causal predictors of post stroke behaviour
              is discussed. The present article argues that, given these
              predictors, different strategies are required in the evaluation
              of model quality in lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke

              outcome for people with severe motor impairment, as both clinical
              tests and corticospinal tract (CST) microstructure may not
              reliably indicate severe motor impairment. Here, we test whether
              imaging biomarkers beyond the CST relate to severe upper limb
              impairment post-stroke by evaluating white matter microstructure
              in the corpus callosum (CC). In an international, multisite
              hypothesis-generating observational study we determined if: a)
              CST asymmetry index can differentiate between individuals with
              mild-moderate and severe upper limb impairment; and b) CC
              biomarkers relate to upper limb impairment within individuals
              with severe impairment post-stroke. We hypothesised that CST
              asymmetry index would differentiate between mild-moderate and
              severe impairment, but CC microstructure would relate to motor
              outcome for individuals with severe upper limb impairment.
              METHODS: Seven cohorts with individual diffusion imaging and
              motor impairment (Fugl Meyer-Upper Limb) data were pooled.
              Hand-drawn regions-of-interest were used to seed probabilistic
              tractography for CST (ipsilesional/contralesional) and CC
              (prefrontal/premotor/motor/sensory/posterior) tracts. Our main
              imaging measure was mean fractional anisotropy. Linear
              mixed-effect regression explored relationships between candidate
              biomarkers and motor impairment, controlling for observations
              nested within cohorts, as well as age, sex, time post-stroke and
              lesion volume. RESULTS: Data from 110 individuals (30
              mild-moderate, 80 with severe motor impairment) were included. In
              the full sample, greater CST asymmetry index (i.e., lower
              fractional anisotropy in the ipsilesional hemisphere, p<.001) and
              larger lesion volume (p=.139) were negatively related to
              impairment. In the severe subgroup, CST asymmetry index was not
              reliably associated with impairment across models. Instead,
              lesion volume and CC microstructure explained impairment in the
              severe group beyond CST asymmetry index (p's<.010). CONCLUSIONS:
              Within a large cohort of individuals with severe upper limb
              impairment, CC microstructure related to motor outcome
              post-stroke. Our findings demonstrate that CST microstructure
              does relate to upper limb outcome across the full range of motor
              impairment but was not reliably associated within the severe
              subgroup. Therefore, CC microstructure may provide a promising
              biomarker for severe upper limb outcome post-stroke, which may
              advance our ability to predict recovery in people with severe
              motor impairment after stroke.",

              predominantly identified based on distribution of infarct lesions
              in patients with large arterial occlusion; whereas, there is no
              consensus atlas regarding the supply territories of smaller
              end-arteries. In this study, we applied a data-driven approach to
              construct a stroke atlas of the brain using hierarchical density
              clustering in large number of infarct lesions, assuming that
              voxels/regions supplied by a common end-artery tend to infarct
              together. METHODS: A total of 793 infarct lesions on MRI scans of
              458 patients were segmented and coregistered to MNI-152 standard
              brain space. Applying a voxel-wise data-driven hierarchical
              density clustering algorithm, we identified those voxels that
              were most likely to be part of same infarct lesions in our
              dataset. A step-wise clustering scheme was applied, where the
              clustering threshold was gradually decreased to form the first 20
              mother (>50 cm3) or main (1-50 cm3) clusters in addition to any
              possible number of tiny clusters (<1 cm3); and then, any
              resultant mother clusters were iteratively subdivided using the
              same scheme. Also, in a randomly selected 2/3 subset of our
              cohort, a bootstrapping cluster analysis with 100 permutations
              was performed to assess the statistical robustness of proposed
              clusters. RESULTS: Approximately 91\% of the MNI-152 brain mask
              was covered by 793 infarct lesions across patients. The covered
              area of brain was parcellated into 4 mother, 16 main, and 123
              tiny clusters at the first hierarchy level. Upon iterative
              clustering subdivision of mother clusters, the brain tissue was
              eventually parcellated into 1 mother cluster (62.6 cm3), 181 main
              clusters (total volume 1107.3 cm3), and 917 tiny clusters (total
              volume of 264.8 cm3). In bootstrap analysis, only 0.12\% of
              voxels, were labelled as ``unstable'' - with a greater
              reachability distance in cluster scheme compared to their
              corresponding mean bootstrapped reachability distance. On visual
              assessment, the mother/main clusters were formed along supply
              territories of main cerebral arteries at initial hierarchical
              levels, and then tiny clusters emerged in deep white matter and
              gray matter nuclei prone to small vessel ischemic infarcts.
              CONCLUSIONS: Applying voxel-wise data-driven hierarchical density
              clustering on a large number of infarct lesions, we have
              parcellated the brain tissue into clusters of voxels that tend to
              be part of same infarct lesion, and presumably representing
              end-arterial supply territories. This hierarchical stroke atlas
              of the brain is shared publicly, and can potentially be applied
              for future infarct location-outcome analysis.",

              Maps (AnaCOM): method and validation. NeuroImage 37: 1237-1249.)
              have recently described a novel approach for lesion-behavior
              mapping (LBM), referred to as Anatomo-Clinical Overlapping Maps
              (AnaCOM). Conventional voxelwise LBM tools apply statistics to
              contrast behavioral performance of patients with lesions that
              encompass given voxels to control patients where these voxels are
              spared. In contrast, AnaCOM contrasts performance of patients
              with injury involving given voxels to the performance of
              neurologically healthy participants. The authors correctly note
              that their procedure can offer substantially more statistical
              power than conventional LBM methods. We compared AnaCOM to
              conventional LBM techniques by examining hemiparesis (a common
              consequence of stroke) as the behavior of interest. We found that
              AnaCOM detected many regions of the middle cerebral artery
              territory not associated with the motor system. We suggest that
              conventional LBM techniques detect regions that are damaged in
              patients with a deficit while spared in those without a deficit,
              while AnaCOM detects regions that are associated with a deficit.
              Therefore, this new measure may offer poor specificity.
              Furthermore, on theoretical grounds we suggest that
              permutation-based thresholding will be a more sensitive method
              for controlling familywise error than the method of counting
              lesion-overlap clusters used by AnaCOM. Finally, we note that the
              within group variability tends to be smaller for neurologically
              healthy controls than in neurological patients, due to ceiling
              effects. Therefore, we suggest that nonparametric measures or the
              Welch's t-test are more appropriate than the conventional pooled
              variance t-test used by AnaCOM.",

  abstract = "Lesion to symptom mapping (LSM) is a crucial tool for
              understanding the causality of brain-behavior relationships. The
              analyses are typically performed by applying statistical methods
              on individual brain voxels (VLSM), a method called the
              mass-univariate approach. Several authors have shown that VLSM
              suffers from limitations that may decrease the accuracy and
              reliability of the findings, and have proposed the use of
              multivariate methods to overcome these limitations. In this
              study, we propose a multivariate optimization technique known as
              sparse canonical correlation analysis for neuroimaging (SCCAN)
              for lesion to symptom mapping. To validate the method and compare
              it with mass-univariate results, we used data from 131 patients
              with chronic stroke lesions in the territory of the middle
              cerebral artery, and created synthetic behavioral scores based on
              the lesion load of 93 brain regions (putative functional units).
              LSM analyses were performed with univariate VLSM or SCCAN, and
              the accuracy of the two methods was compared in terms of both
              overlap and displacement from the simulated functional areas.
              Overall, SCCAN produced more accurate results - higher dice
              overlap and smaller average displacement - compared to VLSM. This
              advantage persisted at different sample sizes (N = 20-131) and
              different multiple comparison corrections (false discovery rate,
              FDR; Bonferroni; permutation-based family wise error rate, FWER).
              These findings were replicated with a fully automated SCCAN
              routine that relied on cross-validated predictive accuracy to
              find the optimal sparseness value. Simulations of one, two, and
              three brain regions showed a systematic advantage of SCCAN over
              VLSM; under no circumstance could VLSM exceed the accuracy
              obtained with SCCAN. When considering functional units composed
              of multiple brain areas VLSM identified fewer areas than SCCAN.
              The investigation of real scores of aphasia severity (aphasia
              quotient and picture naming) showed that SCCAN could accurately
              identify known language-critical areas, while VLSM either
              produced diffuse maps (FDR correction) or few scattered voxels
              (FWER correction). Overall, this study shows that a multivariate
              method, such as, SCCAN, outperforms VLSM in a number of
              scenarios, including functional dependency on single or multiple
              areas, different sample sizes, different multi-area combinations,
              and different thresholding mechanisms (FWER, Bonferroni, FDR).
              These results support previous claims that multivariate methods
              are in general more accurate than mass-univariate approaches, and
              should be preferred over traditional VLSM approaches. All the
              methods described in this study are available in the newly
              developed LESYMAP package for R.",

              sensorimotor area tract template (SMATT) which segments
              corticofugal tracts based on 6 cortical regions in primary motor
              cortex, dorsal premotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex,
              supplementary motor area (SMA), pre-supplementary motor area
              (preSMA), and primary somatosensory cortex using diffusion tensor
              imaging. Individual probabilistic tractography analyses were
              conducted in 100 subjects using the highest resolution data
              currently available. Tractography results were refined using a
              novel algorithm to objectively determine slice level thresholds
              that best minimized overlap between tracts while preserving tract
              volume. Consistent with tracing studies in monkey and rodent, our
              observations show that cortical topography is generally preserved
              through the internal capsule, with the preSMA tract remaining
              most anterior and the primary somatosensory tract remaining most
              posterior. We combine our results into a freely available white
              matter template named the SMATT. We also provide a probabilistic
              SMATT that quantifies the extent of overlap between tracts.
              Finally, we assess how the SMATT operates at the individual
              subject level in another independent data set, and in an
              individual after stroke. The SMATT and probabilistic SMATT
              provide new tools that segment and label sensorimotor tracts at a

  abstract = "Background The ability to predict outcome after stroke is
              clinically important for planning treatment and for
              stratification in restorative clinical trials. In relation to the
              upper limbs, the main predictor of outcome is initial severity,
              with patients who present with mild to moderate impairment
              regaining about 70\% of their initial impairment by 3 months
              post-stroke. However, in those with severe presentations, this
              proportional recovery applies in only about half, with the other
              half experiencing poor recovery. The reasons for this failure to
              recover are not established although the extent of corticospinal
              tract damage is suggested to be a contributory factor. In this
              study, we investigated 30 patients with chronic stroke who had
              presented with severe upper limb impairment and asked whether it
              was possible to differentiate those with a subsequent good or
              poor recovery of the upper limb based solely on a T1-weighted
              structural brain scan. Methods A support vector machine approach
              using voxel-wise lesion likelihood values was used to show that
              it was possible to classify patients as good or poor recoverers
              with variable accuracy depending on which brain regions were used
              to perform the classification. Results While considering damage
              within a corticospinal tract mask resulted in 73\% classification
              accuracy, using other (non-corticospinal tract) motor areas
              provided 87\% accuracy, and combining both resulted in 90\%
              accuracy. Conclusion This proof of concept approach highlights
              the relative importance of different anatomical structures in
              supporting post-stroke upper limb motor recovery and points
              towards methodologies that might be used to stratify patients in
              future restorative clinical trials.",

              investigation of the brain white matter pathways non-invasively.
              However a fundamental limitation of this technology is its
              non-quantitative nature, i.e. the density of reconstructed
              connections is not reflective of the density of underlying white
              matter fibres. As a solution to this problem, we have previously
              published the ``spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of
              tractograms (SIFT)'' method, which determines a subset of the
              streamlines reconstruction such that the streamlines densities
              throughout the white matter are as close as possible to fibre
              densities estimated using the spherical deconvolution diffusion

              biological marker of connection density. Particular aspects of
              its performance may have however limited its uptake in the
              diffusion MRI research community. Here we present an alternative
              to this method, entitled SIFT2, which provides a more logically
              direct and computationally efficient solution to the streamlines

              appropriate cross-sectional area multiplier for each streamline
              rather than removing streamlines altogether, biologically
